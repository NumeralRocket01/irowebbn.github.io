I've been into open-source for some time, ever since I brought my shcool's old laptops back to life with my friend's Puppy Linux disc. I was amazed at how a project could reach quality at or above that of it's proprietary counterparts, and still remain free ([both as in beer and as in speech](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)). In this lies a revolution of open-source: if a project is free (of charge), then users are attracted, and if it is free (to contribute), then users who find it usefull are motivated to contribute, which makes the project better and attracts more potential contributers.

I always wanted to get involved in the open-source community, but I am not technically advanced (yet!). But then I saw how [Mozilla](mozilla.org), the makers of Firefox, had ways for novices to contribute, like documentation and support. I got my feet wet by [editing some articles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/irowe) on HTML standards. For people who don't know what that means, I would recommend Mozilla's [Army of Awesome](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/army-of-awesome), where you can help Firefox users out on Twitter.

This brings me to Google Code-In
