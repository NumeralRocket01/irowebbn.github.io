   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; : This essay was originally written as an assignment for a creative writing class. If you find it to drag on near the end, understand that this is due to the fact that I was trying to reach a page length requirement. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently went to Yucatan, Mexico on a mission trip with my church. No, this won’t be a cliché “what I learned on a mission trip” essay, although I did learn a lot about the people there and about my faith. But in a tangible sense, I learned a lot about economics in the real world and the relation between poverty and &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mexico, there’s people in poverty who don’t have that many things. Real poverty, in the way that most people think about it. Most buildings are unfinished, many only have dirt floors, and none are more than a few rooms at the largest. When I hear people talk mention poor kids in other countries, this is what I picture.&lt;img src=&quot;images/mexico-thatch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve also come to realize that the there’s another type of poverty, and it is a completely different animal. Take, for example, the many homes in the Appalachian region of our state where people live in dilapidated structures, and where children’s lunches are funded by the state schools. Now look in their yards and back lots. Typically, I imagine seeing loads and loads of stuff. Multiple cars, trucks, tractors lay abandoned, while stacks on unused toys scatter the plot. How can a family with two relatively new cars and four rusting Ford F-150’s not be able to buy their kids food? And what are they doing with smartphones? It seems like poor prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well actually they can buy food, if you could call it that. Fast food chains offer availability and affordability at the sacrifice of nutrition, which is why obesity is associated with poverty in the west, contrary to what was once thought. Real food that helps the body costs significantly more, because our society has put a higher value on health than others historically have. Now it is the privilege of the wealthy to be thin and eat simple foods, and the market has driven it out of reach for others.&lt;img src=&quot;images/american-poor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Yucatan, although the average income is about $10 USD a day, due to advantages in climate fresh food is easily available. Education, infrastructure,  and security are out of reach, but food is not. The cost of living seems to me to be very to low, if you need it to be. The problem is that in America (and probably other developed countries) the essential things like food cost more and the “luxuries” like education and transportation cost less, leaving poor people in an unfortunate situation. At risk of sounding unsympathetic to those in the most severe of situations, many considered in poverty will get by just fine. But is mere continuance good enough? Is the guarantee of a life expectancy longer than the rest of the world enough to say, “That’s fine, these people aren’t poor anymore, move along”, or should we be constantly saying “We’re not quite there yet, these conditions need to improve?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should break off a bit here and clarify that I don’t think that well-to-do people are obligated to spend their disposable income on the poor, or that it is a sin, morally or socially, to be wealthy. Giving away money doesn’t solve the problem. More than anything, employment, education and technological advancements  (An example of how those who spend resources on things other that overt philanthropy can have the largest impact) make a difference to these poor people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thoughts are all to say that I don’t know what to think about poverty, about whether it is relative to the environment around it, a line to be crossed, or a ladder to be climbed. These thoughts come most when I’m cleaning at home. I think, “Why do I have so much stuff?” and find ways to get rid of it. Many very poor people, like those in Mexico, would like to find ways to get more stuff. But as hungry people in America might tell them, stuff doesn’t help. Many of these things could help those in need, but it really doesn’t move them on the scale towards being better of in comparison with the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel burdened with been privilege sometimes, which makes me sound like I’m some sort of suck up. I really am confused on what poverty really is. Is it surviving on the essentials and lacking everything else and being content? Or is it living in the excess but lacking the essentials and being miserable? Or does poverty even extend to someone who is fine but has nothing compared to his neighbors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I volunteered with some others at a food bank. “The face of hunger may surprise you,” they said, and I believe them. Now many people without food can receive it. The same people who have cars and trucks and go to school with rich kids but can’t eat have food. But what about kids in Mexico who have food but little hope of progress in the future? Is hunger the baseline for poverty?  I don’t know, but I do think there is a responsibility to address this rather than ignore it. Not that we all need to give our money away, or can’t enjoy our own things, but we need to at least come to terms with this modern phenomenon of a hungry person with stuff. I have yet to find something that satisfactorily poses a solution to this dilemma.  In the meantime, I have a lot of stuff that gets donated to Goodwill. Consumer goods are no longer the mark of wealth. The lack of excess things is a privilege in this nation. I hope that I am blessed to find myself in a spot where it doesn’t matter what kind of poor someone is, they can be helped. Again, I’m just running on post-missions trip save-the-world vibes. But it is a strange juxtaposition for a strange modern age. Such is the burden of too many things.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tech Predictions for 2015</title>
   <link href="http://www.isaacrowe.net/2015/01/27/tech-predictions/"/>
   <published>2015-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</published>
   <updated>2015-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.isaacrowe.net/2015/01/27/tech-predictions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2014 was a big year in technology. Wearable technology broke into the public consciousness, drones had everyone buzzing, smartphones got bigger (again), and large-scale cyberattacks grabbed headlines. Given that the consumer electronics industry is now intricately interwoven with modern culture, predicting the trends of the industry is akin to to looking into the future. And because it’s not cool to be a clickbait post that makes vague and generally accurate but unhelpful predictions, each prediction will end with one very bold and probably ridiculous statement. That being said, here are my predictions for technology trends in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: On the Vergecast Ep. 135, the last day of CES, Casey Newton talks about two of my points (cars and IoT) with nearly the same opinion Listen to that podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/the_verge/the-vergecast-135-ces-2015-day-3#t=38:10&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, at 38:10 for the part about cars and &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/the_verge/the-vergecast-135-ces-2015-day-3#t=39:08&quot;&gt;about a minute later&lt;/a&gt; for the part about Internet of Things, which I find quite funny. I promise this article was written before I heard the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;internet-of-things-gets-a-rebrand&quot;&gt;Internet of Things gets a rebrand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet of things. One of the biggest buzzwords of 2014, but does the average consumer know what that means? Many manufacturers mistakenly think that adding a screen or a remote control app to every appliance makes it “smart” but I don’t entirely agree. While being able to start a washer machine at work with an iPhone is admittedly smarter than manually doing so, but that doesn’t make it part of the internet of things. The point of the IoT is to connect everything in a web of communication, like its namesake phenomenon, and I don’t see a whole lot of entries in that space. An example would be if a home security system turned on interior lights when it detected  motion, or all devices when into “away mode” when one device, like a Nest thermostat does. A good rule of thumb is that if it’s not on the list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/channels&quot;&gt;IFTTT channels&lt;/a&gt;  (the digital manifestation of the internet of everything), it’s not actually the an IoT device. Until someone figures out the magic recipe for IoT, I think the hype will die, mostly because brands think people want their television to talk to their dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bold Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The Internet of Things stops being “the thing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-driving-cars-come-of-age&quot;&gt;Self driving cars come of age&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in May, Google revealed that the longtime project of modding Toyota Prii (yes, that is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota-announces-the-plural-of-prius.htm&quot;&gt;plural of Prius&lt;/a&gt;) into self-driving vehicles had reached a new milestone: it’s own concept car. Looking like something out of a cartoon, the car has no pedals or steering wheel and is fully functional. Late in 2014, Google asked permission from San Francisco to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-google-self-driving-car-prototype-ready-to-try-road-2014-12&quot;&gt;test its prototype on the road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even just this should be enough to forebode the rise of autonomous vehicles, but it’s not just that: everyone is making self-driving cars. Tesla’s Model S P85D has some sweet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7quu551ehc0#t=38&quot;&gt;self-driving features&lt;/a&gt; (but they’re quick to label it Autopilot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/dual-motor-model-s-and-autopilot&quot;&gt;and not self-driving&lt;/a&gt;). Volvo is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2014/08/volvo-xc90-self-driving/&quot;&gt;on the cutting edge&lt;/a&gt; as well. Many other car companies are introducing self-driving components, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/3657294/ford-ceo-driverless-car/&quot;&gt;lots of naysayers&lt;/a&gt;. I think the technology is progressing faster than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bold Prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2015, Google, likely in tandem with an established car manufacturer, will announce plans to introduce a completely self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tablets-die-a-slow-death&quot;&gt;Tablets die a slow death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the iPad caught on, the use cases for tablets have been this: 1) when a phone proves too small for viewing the content (like movies), 2) when the television is too dumb to access the content (like Netflix), 3)  or when the work too light enough to justify lugging out a laptop.With the  ever-increasing size of smartphones, the plethora of ways to stream content on a television (Roku, Chromecast, Apple/Android TV, and the rise of inexpensive, lightweight laptops (Chromebooks), the use case scenarios for tablets are dwindling. The only hope for tablets is for them to become actual productivity devices, which so far has failed miserably. One one hand, iPads, Kindles, and Android tablets are built for consuming content, and are not equipped for what most people do for work or school (I know a few people who try this with frustration). On the other hand, Microsoft Surface tablets and other various hybrids are build for productivity and have had minimal success, mostly because for a tablet to be productive, it pretty much needs to be a laptop, and becomes a less fun tablet. Bottom line? Laptops are good at being laptops, tablets are good at being tablets. And now that phones are getting bigger, phones are getting to beating tablets at their own game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bold Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Tablet sales, especially smaller ones, will shrink. Apple will introduce multitasking productivity features into iPads to distinguish them from iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;streaming-content-gets-a-boost&quot;&gt;Streaming content gets a boost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think 2015 will be the year that studios realize that after the disc sales have died down, they gain nothing by keeping titles to themselves and off streaming services like Netflix. I eternally hate when titles disappear off Netflix, and I hope we will be seeing this less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor Swift might have gotten away with pulling off Spotify to sell more albums, but anyone with less star power than she would lose out. Even Swift, is not inpervious to grumbling from the hordes of people who are used to are used to having access to any music they desire in exchange for a few advertisements. I think that Spotify will be willing to shell out a few more bucks to keep their claim on such a comprehensive library. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bold Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Taylor Swift comes back to Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-purchases-go-through-the-roof&quot;&gt;Digital purchases go through the roof&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is an interesting juxtaposition to the previous one, and while I think music purchases will decline in favor of streaming services, I think that consumers will be more willing to make digital purchases including digital movies, online services, and apps. In the past, many people balked at anything beyond free apps, and apart from Amazon, online purchase were rare. Now with the ease of Apple Pay, and the recent influx of people using Google Wallet to rent movies (a few million people signed up just to watch &lt;em&gt;The Interview&lt;/em&gt;), people will be less hesitant to buy services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bold Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: Apple Pay takes off&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how those predictions pan out. Have a great 2015!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Coding Testimony</title>
   <link href="http://www.isaacrowe.net/2015/01/22/my-coding-testimony/"/>
   <published>2015-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</published>
   <updated>2015-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.isaacrowe.net/2015/01/22/my-coding-testimony</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, there was a calculator. A TI-83 Plus, to be exact. Purchased off of Ebay for 8th grade Algebra, it was not a glamourous device. Someone said you could play games on it. I didn’t know how to get any on there. But there was a button, labelled PGRM, that seemed promising. “NEW”, “EDIT”, “EXEC”. Sounds familiar. I’ve never programmed before,  but I get to know my way around computers faster than some. The first program is a Quadratic Formula calculator, using what we were learning in class, just some math functions. Eventually I realized that all the commands are cataloged in the calculator. A “Guess the Number” program results. Someone gives me a link cable. CatalogHelp, and a handmade pong game make it to my calculator (also MirageOS for games, finally). What enthralls me is that I am in control of making the calculator do whatever I want, but I just have to learn the right words, available from an infinite combination of commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9th grade geometry. My friend and I are bored in class and our teacher tells us that if we learn some code to present the lessons in a creative way, we would be exempt from the test. My friend, who had also recently dabbled in programming, shows me htmldog.com. Between that and W3Schools, we hack together a website with pages for each lesson. I can honestly say that while I did grasp HTML, I did not understand a single line of CSS that I typed/pasted in. As always, with enough blind following of tutorials and tinkering with code, I gained a understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the Geometry site that still floats about on a Google Drive folder, there is code from a Mozilla Developer Network snippet. Of all the resources I used, that one was of the highest quality. I was very grateful to them, and to give back, I joined the documentation team to make edits to developer documentation (I had no idea what I was doing, but I could fix typos). One day (May 30, 2013 as Gmail tells me), a person saying he is a highschool student says he found some broken links while doing some minor edits (as I was doing). I immediately emailed him privately and asked him how he was learning coding. He said he learned JavaScript and Python from Codecademy.com. On June 24, I signed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few web courses on Codecademy and many project websites later (My friend and I are working on posting all our documented old work), I have a working knowledge of HTML and CSS. I still don’t know what I want to know, and that is programming. I get bogged down in a JavaScript course. Another course I try is over my head. I somewhat muck along slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fall, I started an internship with Awesome Inc. I want to help their developers, but I can’t really help out too much, so I stick with writing, my other strength. Then I get asked to make a website, which I haven’t done in a while. I find it comes much easier this time. I catch the bug again. I find out that there are people super-willing to help with any question I have. I try a Udemy course on Jekyll. Not much programming, but it had good lessons in workflow, and I learned how to use Git. Last month, I had to set a metric that matters. Blog posts are hard to quantify, so I chose hours spent learning code (shooting for 60, with 10 in the first week).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I reach my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Trying my hand at Google Code-In</title>
   <link href="http://www.isaacrowe.net/2015/01/04/trying-google-code-in/"/>
   <published>2015-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</published>
   <updated>2015-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.isaacrowe.net/2015/01/04/trying-google-code-in</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been into open-source for some time, ever since I brought my school’s old laptops back to life with my friend’s Puppy Linux disc. I was amazed at how a project could reach quality at or above that of its proprietary counterparts, and still remain free (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;both as in beer and as in speech&lt;/a&gt;). In this lies a revolution of open-source: if a project is free (of charge), then users are attracted, and if it is free (to contribute), then users who find it useful are motivated to contribute, which makes the project better and attracts more potential contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to get involved in the open-source community, but I am not technically advanced (yet!). But then I saw how &lt;a href=&quot;mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, the makers of Firefox, had ways for novices to contribute, like documentation and support. I got my feet wet by &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/irowe&quot;&gt;editing some articles&lt;/a&gt; on HTML standards. For people who don’t know what that means, I would recommend Mozilla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/army-of-awesome&quot;&gt;Army of Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, where you can help Firefox users out on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to Google Code-In. It’s no secret that I would like to become a programmer and work for a company like Google, but so far my CS and programming education has been largely self-guided and slow (Shoutout to Codecademy and my new best friend Sal Khan, seriously, their stuff is great), and I usually can’t contribute to things because they are mostly over my head. For those who don’t know, Google Code-In is a contest sponsored by Google where high school students can complete tasks for various open-source organizations for prizes. One task completed gets a certificate, three gets a T-shirt, and a completing a large number of creative tasks qualifies finalists for other prizes. Each student can only do 2 beginner tasks. So when my friend (the same one with the Linux images) sent me the link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing this year’s Google Code-In, I assumed I would not be able to help in any significant capacity.”Maybe I’ll try next year when I know more programming,” I thought to myself. But then I saw this on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/getting-started&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and I was in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Open Source Fundamentals:
You can contribute without being a coder!
You do not have to be a coder to contribute to open source. There are many different skill sets needed to help an open source community thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide went on to list ways to contribute: Documentation, Research, Outreach, Training, and User Interface. I don’t have to wait until I’m a coding master to help open source organizations, I can help now! What’s more, is that by helping in small, non-technical ways, I can still glean valuable information not only about programming, but about how to work with a community, help others, and challenge myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first task I did with Google Code-In probably didn’t help Copyleft Games, the mentor organization much. It was marked “beginner”, and all I had do was set up Copyleft’s 3D game engine on my computer, run a demo rendering, and take a screenshot. The task was really about introducing students to tools used for Linux development, but I still hit a few roadblocks. For example, did you know that you need Python 3, not 2 to install PySoy with WAF, and you need to compile Python with the &lt;code&gt;--enable-shared flag&lt;/code&gt; in order for an interpreter to be embedded into another application? Neither did I. So here’s a thank you to Arc Riley, a mentor, as well as @ubuntor and @poxip, whose real names I may never know. Thank you for listening to my dumb questions on IRC (I also learned not to ask to ask, but to ask). Below is the screenshot I submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PySoyDemo.png&quot; alt=&quot;My first task&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s where I am now. While looking through more available task, I found a task from Sugar, the group that make software for those laptops they give to kids in Africa, titled “Introduce Yourself”. Here is what it said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Write a blog post about why you are participating in Google Code-In, what you hope to learn from the GCI and how mariahvillarreal [a mentor] can help you. Include a picture. Share blog post through social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No,” you think to yourself,”I’ve been fooled into reading this high-school kid just wrote to get a t-shirt from Google, he doesn’t care about this stuff at all!” Well, that is partly true. This post is a response to that task, and it does help me win a t-shirt. But this blog post serves as more than that. In order to express my gratitude for this task not being marked “beginner”, I have turned this in to something more, a call to action for everyone, even those not technically inclined, to contribute to open source, because that’s what Google Code-In is about. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcworld.com/article/209891/10_reasons_open_source_is_good_for_business.html&quot;&gt;Open source is really important&lt;/a&gt;; nearly every piece of technology you use relies on some open source (you can find the GNU Open Source License on an Apple iPhone), and the best way to show gratitude is to give back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in response to the prompt, I am participating in the Google Code-In because I believe in open source. I hope to learn more about programming but also about the communities behind each of these organizations. mariahvillarreal can help me by getting this word out. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Mariah. Now show this to everyone at Sugar Labs. Judges at Google, share this to your friends. Tweet about it. Everyone can get involved in open source. I hope this little post helps inspire a few.&lt;/p&gt;
