#Intro 

So you want to make a website? Good for you! Making a website was my first step into coding, and it's not that hard to learn. If you follow these steps, you can have a working website in no time, made completely by you.

First thing first, none of this tutorial is completely original. I have been influenced by multiple other great online resources such as [HTML Dog](htmldog.com), [Codecademy](codecademy.com), and [Awesome Inc U](awesomeincu.com)

Secondly, I probably made a lot of mistakes that will cause you trouble.
